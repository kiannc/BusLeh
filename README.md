  <a href="busleh.xyz">BusLeh</a> is a web application that checks for the estimated arrvial time of the bus in Singapore.
  The application uses LTA's API to get the real time data. 
</p>

## Motivation
The motivation of implementing this application is that I didn't want to install unnecessary applications on my phone and want to get the arrival time with a single tap, so I decided to create this web application and hook it up with iOS shortcut.

## Implementation
What i did was to create a route and make the appropriate api call with the bus stop code I wanted then plug it into iOS shortcut. 

#### For example:
 busleh.xyz/busArrival/78101
